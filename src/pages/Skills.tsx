          I daily-drive Typescript, but have experience with Lua, Go, Python and
          PHP. As for Devops, I'm a big fan of Kubernetes.

          I specialize in building scalable, service-centric architectures using
          technologies like JWT-authenticated REST APIs, gRPC, and GraphQL. Over
          the years, I've worked on a wide range of applications, designed
          robust CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitLab CI, CircleCI, and GitHub
          Actions, and built reliable, platform-agnostic systems on AWS and
          Google Cloud.

          Observability is a big part of my workflowâ€”tools like Elasticsearch,
          Kibana, and Prometheus help me gather telemetry, ship logs, and set up
          real-time monitoring to ensure systems run smoothly and reliably.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          I'm all about using the right tool for the job. I've worked with
          messaging systems like RabbitMQ, Redis, Kafka, and SQS; databases like
          PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB; and infrastructure-as-code
          tools like Kubernetes, Helm, and Ansible. I also have experience with
          caching solutions like Redis and Memcached to optimize performance.

        <Typography variant="body1">
          On the frontend, I've built applications with React, Next.js, Vite,
          and even dabbled in Angular. I've also integrated third-party APIs
          like Stripe, PayPal, Twilio, and Google APIs to create seamless user
          experiences. My goal is always the same: to build software that's
          functional, scalable, and solves real problems.

          I'm passionate about learning and constantly expanding my skill set.
          Right now, I'm diving into Rust and loving the challenge of exploring
          a new language. I thrive in environments where I'm encouraged to
          tackle new problems, experiment with different technologies, and push
          the boundaries of what I know. For me, every project is an opportunity
          to grow and bring fresh ideas to the table.
